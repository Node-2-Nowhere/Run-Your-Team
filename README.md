# Run-Your-Team

# Description

In this project we were instructed to build a full stack interactive app including, but not limited to, technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL all while using a file structure that met the MVC paradigm. This app will allow league managers to login after they have established an email and password to update and/or create the results of a league. The league manager (user) will be able to add games and teams and leagues. This is a sport agnostic app as statistics specific to different sports are not used.

# Installation

Here is the deployed link to used the app: https://run-your-team.onrender.com

# Usage

When the user arrives at the homepage they will be asked to either login in to their account or to create a login with an email and password.

Once they sign in the user will be redirected to a new page where they are able to see the teams that are in the league along with the league id and team id.

![RYT Team Display](<public/phyllisTest/images/RYT Team Display.png>)

If the user continues to scroll down the page below to the list of teams they will see the ability and add teams along with their league id.
